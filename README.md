# About me ðŸ‘‹


Hello! I'm Katsiaryna, an enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I'm currently working in the field of NLP, specifically focusing on a question-answering domain.

In addition to my work in NLP, I'm also deeply passionate about other AI domains, such as Graph Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Anomaly Detection. I'm eager to further explore and contribute to these exciting areas of study ðŸŒŸ


## Publications

During my studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with PhD students on research projects.

I took part in a publication [A deeper look at Graph Embedding RetroFitting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2023.101979) (IF: 3.3, MEiN: 100), where I extended the work by applying node-retrofitting methods on the edges of the graph. 

## Education:
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. I also attended courses in the Mathematics Department as a free listener, which allowed me to get a strong background in two majors.

## Projects: 
Here are my most significant projects:
- [Unsupervised MLP pre-training for Graph Neural Network](https://github.com/katsiarynaviarenich/mlp-pretrain)

This project extends the implementation of the MLP-Init method presented in ICLR 2023, which initially incorporated MLP pre-training and supervised Graph Neural Networks. I enhanced it by integrating the unsupervised Deep Graph Infomax model.

- [Birds image generation](https://github.com/KatsiarynaViarenich/Generative-models-for-birds-generation)
  
I implemented a diffusion model from scratch for generating bird images. I further improved it by introducing skip connections and attention mechanisms to enhance the image generation process.

- [Movie Score Predictions](https://github.com/katsiarynaviarenich/movie-score-predictions)
  
I gathered data from the TMDB website and evaluated the performance of ten popular Machine Learning models commonly used in table-based data analysis. The project involved feature extraction and a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis.

- [BookLingo](https://github.com/katsiarynaviarenich/BookLingo)
  
I collaborated with a fellow student to develop a book reader, which allows storage and removal of books and offers features such as translation and auto-generating questions based on the content. We utilized the Hugging Face T5 model API. The GUI was developed using QT and PySide. We also incorporated SQL for efficient database management.

## Conclusion
